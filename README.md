# My first website project

## Description 
My first website project that was made in first year alongside Domantas and Sean. It is a simple Christmas charity page with a nice logo that I designed using three "C"s.
Children's Charities for Christmas. 

The webpage brings awarness to struggling families and children with an intractable gallery that users can read from, trying to convince them to give a simple donation via the sign up page. 

The webpage has a cool dice game that the user can play with going against an AI. 

## Tools used
Simple web development tools were used to create this project: Such as HTML for foundation, CSS for design and JavaScript for functionality.
